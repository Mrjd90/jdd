- The model predicts the price of the house using other variables such as area, Number of bedrooms,furnished or not etc.
- after cleaning, I did the EDA to explor data and visualize the data point to determin outliers adn skewness.
- One hotencoder do numaries the non numerical variables i.e Furnished, unfurnised etc,
- I used RandomForestRegressor for model development
- I MUST SAY THIS MODEL IS NOT ACCURATE ENOUGH, I DID NOT DO MUCH OF DATA CLEANING I.E, Multicollinearity detection and removal. removin skew data point etc.
